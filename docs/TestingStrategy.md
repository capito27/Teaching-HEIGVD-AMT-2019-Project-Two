## Project-One

### Testing Strategy
We implemented extensive endpoint testing through the Cucumber JVM testing framework.

As well as manual testing though the Swagger UI.

All cucumber tests will revert their modifications, but are dependent on the initial database state.

We didn't implement entity unit testing due to using the lombok framework to generate all boilerplate code in them.

We also implemented performance testing, but that will be explicited in it's own document.
