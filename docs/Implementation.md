## Project-One

## Global

We took advantage of the API interface generated by OpenAPIGenerator to quickly have a API Controller skelletion, and simply implemented its methods according to the spec.

We took advantage of the JPA repository ( CrudRepository in particular) to implement the database communication.
We took advantage of Hibernate's reflectivity to dynamically generate as many database queries as possible without having to produce the actual SQL code associated.

We took advantage of the Lombok annotations, mainly @Data, to automatically generate our Entity boilerplate.

We also took advantage of annotations to implement our persistence layer, such as to define some of the non-standard column names from our databases

We took advantage of the servlet filters to define the CORS values, which still remained at their default, unsecured values.

## Auth

We took advantage of Spring's WebFilter, spcfically OncePerRequestFilter, to force user authentification verifications, as well as to transmit user claims from the JWT token to the relevant endpoints.

We also decided to store the user's mail, ID and status (admin or regular) in the JWT token, which would be of use for both APIs.

## Match API

We took advantage of the JPA anotations to simplify how we represented our entities and their relations ( with the "OneToMany" and "ManyToOne" relations)
